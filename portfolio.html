			I am very passionate about automation of tedious tasks, in both real life and computer world.  I get anxious when I get errors while I try to run the program that I write. It is because I wouldn't otherwise get to do a research on new topics as they may not come along.

		Through this medium, I am looking for an opportunity that will help me strengthen my programming skills. I have been thriving to experience the pleasure of being able to make it happen using my technical problem solving skills. I have been eager to put out what I have learnt in my college years, into somewhere I can make a small contribution that is eventually going to make a difference, a huge one.

		Firstly, I have experienced that I am that person who likes to sit down working on projects for long hours, without having to worry about a thing. I have worked as a food service worker for almost 2 years. During that time frame, I have excelled my time management skills, multi-tasking ability, pressure handling ability and I had been held responsible for all these small tasks that I performed that ultimately led to bigger results, combined.
